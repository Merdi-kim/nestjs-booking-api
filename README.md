# Booking api with nest.js
This project implements a hotel booking api built with nest.js. We're taking full advantage of nest.js features to builf a REST api that allows users to signin/signup. Users have the ability to book a hotel room, delete their order and bookmark hotels that they like. On the other hand, we have features for listing a new hotel, updating prices for hotels and deleting hotels from the database(if needed).
